# challenge-2 create a Portfolio 

## Description

I have crafted a comprehensive portfolio that encompasses the following elements:

Header: The portfolio prominently features the developer's name and avatar. It includes functional links leading to sections about the developer, their work, and contact information.

Navigation: Functional links facilitate seamless scrolling to the corresponding sections.

Featured Application: The developer's inaugural application takes center stage on the page, presented with a larger image to distinguish it from the rest of their projects.

Project Pages: Clicking on project images redirects users to the respective webpages for a more in-depth exploration.

Responsive Layout: The webpage boasts a responsive design that dynamically adjusts to the viewport, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various devices.
